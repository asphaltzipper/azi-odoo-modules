                For Odoo Enterprise Version 16.0, this module replaces the default Odoo purple color palette with a blue based color
                palette. By editing the CSS and SCSS files in this module, you can further personalize Odoo
                with your own color choices. This is a very simple module.
                It serves as an ideal example for those who are learning how to build modules with Odoo.
