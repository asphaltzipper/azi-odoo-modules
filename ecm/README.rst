======================================
Manage Engineering Changes to Products
======================================

This module adds features to track and manage product versions.  Engineering changes to a product can be documented with notes, drawing attachments, etc.  Product changes are grouped into Engineering Change Orders (ECOs).  ECOs are used to manage timing and compatibility.  For compatibility, products must be transitioned to the new versions simultaneously.

Configuration
=============

Modify the default ECO phases and approvals to match your workflow.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to ECM
#. Create an ECO
#. Add products to the ECO
#. Attach change drawings to each product
#. Advance the ECO
#. Specify approvals
#. Create new product versions
#. Modify and compare revised BOMs
#. Update and compare parent BOMs
#. Close the ECO
