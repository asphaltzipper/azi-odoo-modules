This module extends the OCAs stock_valuation_fifo_lot module.  Some of these changes
should be contributed to that module, and removed from this module.

Specific Identification costing was
called 'Real Cost', in the older Odoo versions that supported it.

- Add revaluation by lot/serial
- Compute stock value by lot/serial
- Compute quant value by lot/serial
